	\s[0]I think my favorite thing about this new cave is the way the light comes in through the entrance...
	
	\s[4]The way it reflects off our trinkets and casts a glow on the walls and ceiling... \s[2]It's amazing!
}

talk RandomTalk
{
	\s[1]I do wonder if this cave is a little TOO exposed... \s[0]But who's going to come all the way out here? \s[2]It'll be fine. \w8\w8\s[1]Probably.
}

talk RandomTalk
{
	\s[0]We have so many shells I was able to sort them by color \f[italic,1]and\f[italic,default] style.
	
	\s[4]It came out so pretty, don't you think?
}

talk RandomTalk
{
	\s[0]They've had all kinds of pretty rock jewelery at the market lately. \s[2]I want to head out there again soon and get more of it.
}

talk RandomTalk
{
	\s[3]I found some super smooth rocks {bythebay}, they feel really nice to hold.
}

talk RandomTalk
{
	\s[0]I want to find another {metal} {necklace} for our collection. \s[0]\i[450]It would fill this spot just perfectly, don't you think?
	
	\s[2]Let me know if you find anything, hehe~!
}

talk RandomTalk
{
	\s[2]All these {rubies} sparkle so nicely together! \s[0]I wonder if we can find more of them somewhere...
}

talk RandomTalk
{
	\s[1]I should rearrange all these rocks sometime... They've gotten a bit mixed up, haven't they?
}

talk RandomTalk
{
	%{
		local lmetal = metal();
	}
	\s[4]I finally found a nice {lmetal} {necklace} with {rubies}! \s[2]It ties together this {lmetal} set so well, doesn't it?
}

talk RandomTalk
{
	\s[1]Oh, don't go over there. I made a mess and haven't cleaned it up yet, hehe...
	
	I'll get to it just as soon as I've finished reorganizing these {rubies}.
}

talk RandomTalk
{
	\s[0]I've been working on cleaning up the sand in here and removing debris.
	
	\s[2]The only thing that should be in with the sand is our treasures, hehe~!
}

talk RandomTalk
{
	\s[0]Hey, have you seen where that {metal} {necklace} I had the other day got to?
	
	\s[1]I don't know where it went... but I'm sure it'll show up eventually!
}

talk RandomTalk
{
	\s[3]I want to head to the reef again sometime soon, it's so pretty out there!
}

talk RandomTalk
{
	\s[0]I saw a crab earlier while I was cleaning up...
	
	\s[2]It was cute. I took a break to watch it for a while.
}

talk RandomTalk
{
	\s[0]Sometimes I feel like I could spend forever in here reorganizing and never get bored...
	
	\s[4]But then again, exploring is fun too~!
}

talk RandomTalk
{
	\s[0]I've been thinking I might take some of the kelp from the cave entrance back to the market.
	
	\s[4]I think it might be nice to have a new headband or necklace made.
}

talk RandomTalk
{
	\s[2]I've been working on gathering a new pile of pebbles.
	
	\s[0]I'll have them turned into something eventually, but I need to collect enough to sort them into colors first.
}

talk RandomTalk
{
	\s[1]Sometimes I worry about someone else finding our stash and taking it all.
	
	\s[3]But honestly, if they could carry all of this and still swim, I think I'd be impressed~!
}

talk RandomTalk
{
	\s[0]I think the water is a little cooler here than at home. \s[0]\i[450]Have you noticed?
	
	\s[1]I wonder if that's why there aren't as many others around.
}

talk RandomTalk
{
	\s[5]Ooh...\w8\w8
	
	\s[1]Sorry, sorry! I just noticed how pretty your necklace is, \w8\s[2]aah it's nice!!
}

talk RandomTalk
{
	\s[3]Ahh, look at the way this {metal} {necklace} sparkles~!
}

talk RandomTalk
{
	\s[0]I'm trying to find a good spot for this {fork}... \s[6]It doesn't quite fit in with these other {plainmetal} items, does it? \s[1]Hmm...
}

talk RandomTalk
{
	\0\s[6]Have I got too many {plainmetal} items grouped together? \s[1]Maybe I should split them into smaller subcategories...
}

talk RandomTalk
{
	\0\s[2]I got a great deal on this {plainmetal} {fork} at the market. \s[3]For a price like that, I couldn't pass it up~!
}

talk RandomTalk
{
	\0\s[0]Look at all the empty ledges waiting to be filled... \s[4]We should have room for a while yet~!
	
	\s[1]Or at least for a year or two, hehe...
}

talk RandomTalk
{
	\0\s[0]There's a spot nearby where the kelp forest gets even thicker. \s[2]Remind me and I'll show you sometime.
}

talk RandomTalk
{
	\s[5]Wow... \w8\s[2]Look look, look behind you, the sun is catching on those bubbles just right~!
