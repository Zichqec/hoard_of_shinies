	\s[0]I think my favorite thing about this new cave is the way the light comes in through the entrance...
	
	\s[4]The way it reflects off our trinkets and casts a glow on the walls and ceiling... \s[2]It's amazing!
}

talk RandomTalk
{
	\s[1]I do wonder if this cave is a little TOO exposed... \s[0]But who's going to come all the way out here? \s[2]It'll be fine. \w8\w8\s[1]Probably.
}

talk RandomTalk
{
	\s[0]We have so many shells I was able to sort them by color \f[italic,1]and\f[italic,default] style.
	
	\s[4]It came out so pretty, don't you think?
}

talk RandomTalk
{
	\s[0]They've had all kinds of pretty rock jewelery at the market lately. \s[2]I want to head out there again soon and get more of it.
}

talk RandomTalk
{
	\s[3]I found some super smooth rocks {bythebay}, they feel really nice to hold.
}

talk RandomTalk
{
	\s[0]I want to find another {metal} {necklace} for our collection. \s[0]\i[450]It would fill this spot just perfectly, don't you think?
	
	\s[2]Let me know if you find anything, hehe~!
}

talk RandomTalk
{
	\s[2]All these {rubies} sparkle so nicely together! \s[0]I wonder if we can find more of them somewhere...
}

talk RandomTalk
{
	\s[1]I should rearrange all these rocks sometime... They've gotten a bit mixed up, haven't they?
}

talk RandomTalk
{
	%{
		local lmetal = metal();
	}
	\s[4]I finally found a nice {lmetal} {necklace} with {rubies}! \s[2]It ties together this {lmetal} set so well, doesn't it?
}

talk RandomTalk
{
	\s[1]Oh, don't go over there. I made a mess and haven't cleaned it up yet, hehe...
	
	I'll get to it just as soon as I've finished reorganizing these {rubies}.
}

talk RandomTalk
{
	\s[0]I've been working on cleaning up the sand in here and removing debris.
	
	\s[2]The only thing that should be in with the sand is our treasures, hehe~!
}

talk RandomTalk
{
	\s[0]Hey, have you seen where that {metal} {necklace} I had the other day got to?
	
	\s[1]I don't know where it went... but I'm sure it'll show up eventually!
}

talk RandomTalk
{
	\s[3]I want to head to the reef again sometime soon, it's so pretty out there!
}

talk RandomTalk
{
	\s[0]I saw a crab earlier while I was cleaning up...
	
	\s[2]It was cute. I took a break to watch it for a while.
}

talk RandomTalk
{
	\s[0]Sometimes I feel like I could spend forever in here reorganizing and never get bored...
	
	\s[4]But then again, exploring is fun too~!
}

talk RandomTalk
{
	\s[0]I've been thinking I might take some of the kelp from the cave entrance back to the market.
	
	\s[4]I think it might be nice to have a new headband or necklace made.
}

talk RandomTalk
{
	\s[2]I've been working on gathering a new pile of pebbles.
	
	\s[0]I'll have them turned into something eventually, but I need to collect enough to sort them into colors first.
}

talk RandomTalk
{
	\s[1]Sometimes I worry about someone else finding our stash and taking it all.
	
	\s[3]But honestly, if they could carry all of this and still swim, I think I'd be impressed~!
}

talk RandomTalk
{
	\s[0]I think the water is a little cooler here than at home. \s[0]\i[450]Have you noticed?
	
	\s[1]I wonder if that's why there aren't as many others around.
}

talk RandomTalk
{
	\s[5]Ooh...\w8\w8
	
	\s[1]Sorry, sorry! I just noticed how pretty your necklace is, \w8\s[2]aah it's nice!!
}

talk RandomTalk
{
	\s[3]Ahh, look at the way this {metal} {necklace} sparkles~!
}

talk RandomTalk
{
	\s[0]I'm trying to find a good spot for this {fork}... \s[6]It doesn't quite fit in with these other {plainmetal} items, does it? \s[1]Hmm...
}

talk RandomTalk
{
	\0\s[6]Have I got too many {plainmetal} items grouped together? \s[1]Maybe I should split them into smaller subcategories...
}

talk RandomTalk
{
	\0\s[2]I got a great deal on this {plainmetal} {fork} at the market. \s[3]For a price like that, I couldn't pass it up~!
}

talk RandomTalk
{
	\0\s[0]Look at all the empty ledges waiting to be filled... \s[4]We should have room for a while yet~!
	
	\s[1]Or at least for a year or two, hehe...
}

talk RandomTalk
{
	\0\s[0]There's a spot nearby where the kelp forest gets even thicker. \s[2]Remind me and I'll show you sometime.
}

talk RandomTalk
{
	\s[5]Wow... \w8\s[2]Look look, look behind you, the light is catching on those bubbles just perfectly~!
}

talk RandomTalk
{
	\s[0]I saw {ashark} earlier while I was exploring around {thekelpforest}.
	
	\w8\s[1]I kept my distance though, I didn't really want to say hello.
}

talk RandomTalk
{
	\s[0]There's {ashark} that I see off in the distance sometimes when I'm cleaning up the cave entrance.
	
	\s[1]Well, I guess I can't say for sure that it's always the same one... \s[1]\i[451]but I feel like it is.
}

talk RandomTalk
{
	\s[1]I think I lost {agoldcoin} on my way back earlier, while I was swimming around {thekelpforest}.
	
	\s[6]I'll have to go back and search for it.
}

talk RandomTalk
{
	\s[3]Hehe... hehehe... \w8\s[2]Our collection is coming along so nicely~!
}

talk RandomTalk
{
	\s[1]Sometimes I wish the market wasn't so far away.
	
	\s[0]But then again, if it were closer then our stash would be way more likely to be discovered, wouldn't it?
	
	\s[2]This is a good spot, I'm glad we explored out this far.
}

talk RandomTalk
{
	\s[0]I heard a good tip earlier; apparently someone brought in an old chest that has a rusted lock, and nobody's been able to get into it.
	
	\s[2]Sounds like the perfect job for Mica~!
}

talk RandomTalk
{
	\s[0]I found a bunch of pebbles in the kelp forest arranged in the shape of {afish}.
	
	\s[2]It was really neat, I wonder who made it?
}

talk RandomTalk
{
	\s[5]Oh yeah, I wanted to tell you. \s[3]I found a really cool rock with {afish} design scratched into it!
	
	\s[2]I'll take you to see it next time we're out around {thecliffs}~!
}

talk RandomTalk
{
	\s[0]Do you think the others would be impressed with our collection?
	
	\s[1]I wouldn't risk showing it to them, of course, \w4\s[2]but sometimes I like to imagine seeing the envy on their faces!
}

talk RandomTalk
{
	\s[0]Have you seen the new flag old man Rodger got? He has it displayed above his stall at the market.
	
	\s[2]Seems his collection is growing too~!
}

talk RandomTalk
{
	\s[0]I wonder what it'll look like when this place is completely filled...
	
	\s[2]Sparkly, that's for sure, hehe~!
}

talk RandomTalk
{
	\s[0]I'm thinking about starting to put down shells around the cave entrance to form a pattern.
	
	\s[6]I can't decide on a pattern though, so I've just been collecting every nice shell I see...
}

talk RandomTalk
{
	\s[0]Someone asked me what my favorite kind of {metalgem} is. \s[1]I couldn't decide, so I said:
	
	\s[5]... All of them... \w8\w8
	
	\s[6]They didn't like that answer.

	\s[0]I think I want to reorganize these ledges over here. I'm thinking it would be nicer if I moved all those {forks} to the next ledge up so that they're closer to the {rubies}.
}

talk Chain_Reorganizing1
{
	\s[1]Oh, but if I do that, then they're too close to this {metal} collection...
}

talk Chain_Reorganizing1
{
	\s[1]Oh, but then the light wouldn't hit them the same way, that would be a shame...
}

talk Chain_Reorganizing2
{
	\s[1].\w8.\w8. \w8\w8Hmm.
	
	\s[6]Ohh, I don't know, and now I'm getting stressed about it.
	
	\s[1]I'll just leave them be for now and think about it later...
