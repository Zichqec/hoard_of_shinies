Merfolk May was made so that I could learn/practice animating shells for future projects that I am more invested in than this little merfolk. While I myself don't know what else to do with her, I hope if you decide to make her into a full ghost that you have fun with her(and also show her to me owo)

May was made so that there is always something moving! Eyes glancing here and there, hands flopping, tail flipping and fins fluttering.

There are three surfaces already set up, but don't be afraid to change them or make more surfaces for expressions that you want to have.(there are unusued outer eyelids and many arm combinations, have fun.)
The three surfaces have different speeds for tail flips and fins. Surface2 is faster to mimic being flustered, and surface9 has it be slower to mimic a restful sleep. Don't be afraid to copy paste the animations into other surfaces and change the speeds like that to accentuate body language.

The Eyeshine and glances are a ping pong loop (thank you Zichqec's guide) May isn't supposed to be able to focus her eyes on anything for longer than 4 seconds(very excited and curious!!!), but I won't protest if you deem it needed that she stare in one direction for longer to help with an expression you're trying to make!


There are collision boxes set up for May's forehead and gills.
