A ghost that I initially made in an afternoon, and have since expanded upon. Also my first foray into creating a brand new ghost with Aosora. I hope you will enjoy this silly merfolk!

Made using Kipali's Merfolk May freeshell: https://ako-kipali.tumblr.com/ghost-stuff
I made a few edits, including editing one of the optional eyelid frames into a smiling eye expression, as well as some additional animations.
