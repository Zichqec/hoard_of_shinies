A quick ghost made (mostly) in an afternoon! I just had a strong urge to make something new in Aosora.

Made using Kipali's Merfolk May freeshell: https://ako-kipali.tumblr.com/ghost-stuff
I made a few edits, including editing one of the optional eyelid frames into a smiling eye expression, as well as some additional animations.

I hope you will enjoy this silly merfolk! It is very small for now, but I hope to add a bit more over time.
